Youper Ionic Sample Project


This project is a sample for the Youper Hiring Process, it's using Ionic v1, and Angular v1.

Be aware that this is just a sample project, and shouldn't be used in production.

Furtherless, you shouln't be using Ionic V1, nor Angular V1 anymore, it's a ancient framework and gives more headaches than helps.

Please, do consider updating to a more updated version of Ionic, or, even better, using React Native.

The server is inside `server/`, you might run it with a `npm install && node server.js`, please, remember to change the SERVER_URL at the `index.html` file.
